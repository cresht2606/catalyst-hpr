A dedicated and pioneering Data Science project concentrates on predicting real-time real estate based on property features, location and temporal data. The project follows rigorous successive practices, including systematic data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering - preprocessing, model training and evaluation. This workflow is designed to produce experimental and interpretable models that reflect market behavior and enhance decision-making in housing markets.
